The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle the printing of an infinite list by limiting the number of elements printed.

```haskell
import Data.List (iterate)

infiniteList = iterate (+1) 0

printInfiniteList :: IO ()
printInfiniteList = do
  print (take 10 infiniteList) 
```

This improved version only prints a finite portion of the infinite list, preventing non-termination. Note that we removed the problematic `print (infiniteList)` call.

By using `take`, we explicitly limit the number of elements that are evaluated and printed, thereby preventing the program from entering an infinite loop.  This is a key technique for working with infinite data structures in Haskell.

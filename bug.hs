The following Haskell code snippet demonstrates an example of an uncommon error related to lazy evaluation and infinite data structures.  The function `printInfiniteList` attempts to print an infinite list, which leads to non-termination. This is not a syntax error but a runtime error stemming from Haskell's lazy evaluation. 

```haskell
import Data.List (iterate)

infiniteList = iterate (+1) 0

printInfiniteList :: IO ()
printInfiniteList = do
  print (take 10 infiniteList)
  print (infiniteList)
```
